## üéØ Project Goal

The main objective of this website is to create a robust and intuitive platform where football fans can:
* Follow live match results and consult historical data.
* Access detailed team statistics (form, goals, ball possession, etc.).
* Explore player profiles and individual statistics (goals, assists, passes, etc.).
* Visualize in-depth analyses and trends through charts and data visualizations.

## ‚ú® Planned Features

* **Real-time Results:** Minute-by-minute updates for ongoing matches.
* **Match History:** Search and consult past results.
* **Team Profiles:** Dedicated pages with complete statistics, upcoming fixtures, and recent results.
* **Player Profiles:** Biographical data, career statistics, and current performance.
* **Detailed Analytics:** Charts, heatmaps, and other visualizations for team and player statistics.
* **Filters and Search:** Tools to quickly find specific leagues, teams, or players.
* **Responsiveness:** Optimized design for desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Approaches Considered

There are two main paths for building this type of website, each with its advantages:

### 1. Using a CMS (e.g., WordPress with Plugins)

* **Pros:**
    * **Quick Setup:** Ideal for getting a functional website up and running quickly.
    * **Less Coding:** Many football plugins handle data integration and display.
    * **Large Community:** Easy to find help and resources.
* **Cons:**
    * **Limited Customization:** More difficult to create very specific functionalities or complex analyses without custom development.
    * **Performance:** Can be affected if too many unoptimized plugins are used.
* **Key Tools:**
    * **WordPress**
    * **Plugins:** SportsPress, WP Football Facts (or similar plugins that integrate with APIs).

### 2. Custom Development (Code from Scratch)

* **Pros:**
    * **Total Control and Unlimited Customization:** Build exactly what you envision.
    * **Optimized Performance:** Architecture designed for speed and scalability.
    * **Unique Features:** Possibility to develop innovative analytical models and visualizations.
* **Cons:**
    * **More Time-Consuming:** Requires in-depth programming knowledge and more development time.
    * **Steeper Learning Curve:** Need to learn multiple technologies.
    * **Maintenance:** Full responsibility for updates and bug fixes.
* **Key Tools:**
    * **Frontend (User Interface):**
        * **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
        * **Frameworks/Libraries:** React, Angular, Vue.js
    * **Backend (Server and Logic):**
        * **Languages/Frameworks:** Python (with Django/Flask), Node.js (with Express), PHP (with Laravel/Symphony)
    * **Databases:**
        * **Relational:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
        * **Non-Relational (NoSQL):** MongoDB

## üìä Data Sources (APIs)

Obtaining reliable and up-to-date data is crucial. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the most efficient way to programmatically fetch football information.

* **Sportmonks:** One of the most comprehensive and reliable APIs for football data.
* **API-Football:** Good coverage, clear documentation, and flexible pricing options.
* **Football-Data.org:** An excellent free option for non-commercial use, useful for starting and testing concepts.

**Note:** When choosing an API, it's essential to check league/competition coverage, request limits, and associated costs.

## üöß Next Steps and Contribution

This `README` serves as a starting point for the project. The next steps will include:

* Defining the most suitable technical architecture (CMS vs. Custom Development).
* Choosing the primary data API.
* Beginning to develop the database structure and user interface.

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas or wish to collaborate, please open an issue or pull request.
